### Abstract
This 2-days course introduces principles of constraint-based modeling and computational design of metabolic networks coupled with a live demonstration and hands-on exercises with the MATLAB package [CellNetAnalyzer (CNA)](https://www2.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/projects/cna/cna.html) and its Python-variant [CNApy](https://github.com/cnapy-org/CNApy).

#### Day 1
Overview of key methods of constraint-based modeling and metabolic network design (coupled with live demonstration of CNA and CNApy):

-    Fundamentals of constraint-based modeling of metabolic networks 
-    Metabolic flux (balance) analysis
-    Flux Variability analysis
-    Phase planes and Yield spaces
-    Metabolic pathway analysis 
-    Minimal cut sets and computational design of metabolic networks

#### Day 2
Hands-on exercises with CNA and CNApy: the participants will practice the use of CNA or/and CNApy by exercises with small example networks as well as with realistic metabolic models.
