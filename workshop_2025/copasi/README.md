## Advanced Modelling with COPASI
#### Abstract:

COPASI is a widely used software tool for modeling, simulation, and analysis of biochemical reaction networks. Compatible with all major operating systems, it supports a wide range of computational methods—including deterministic and stochastic simulations, steady state analysis, optimization, sensitivity analysis, and more.

This workshop focuses on advanced techniques in parameter estimation, including:

- Integration of heterogeneous data from time course and steady-state experiments
- Identifiability assessments to determine meaningful parameters
- Implementation of constraints and weighting strategies to refine models

Participants will also learn how to automate and customize analyses through scripting with COPASI, expanding their modeling capabilities beyond the graphical user interface.

In the afternoon, participants are encouraged to bring their own models or parameter estimation challenges for a collaborative, hands-on session guided by experts.


#### Educators: 
Frank Bergmann (Heidelberg University), Stefan Hoops (University of Virginia), Ursula Kummer (Heidelberg University), Pedro Mendes (University of Connecticut), Jürgen Pahle (Heidelberg University), Sven Sahle (Heidelberg University)

#### Date:
Oct 10, 2025, 9:30a - 4p (CEST / UTC+2)

#### Location:
