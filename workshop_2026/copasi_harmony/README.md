## Tutorial: Exploring New Features of COPASI
COPASI is a widely used software tool for modeling, simulation, and analysis of biochemical reaction networks. Compatible with all major operating systems, it supports a wide range of computational methods, including deterministic and stochastic simulations, steady state analysis, optimization, sensitivity analysis, and more. As computational modeling becomes increasingly central to systems biology, biotechnology, and quantitative life sciences, COPASI continues to evolve with new features that enhance usability, interoperability, and analytical power.

This tutorial introduces COPASI briefly and then demonstrates some of the newest features available in recent releases. The session is designed to be highly interactive, adapting dynamically to the interests and experience levels of participants. Depending on audience preference, we will explore topics such as advanced plotting, model exchange standards, scripting interfaces, parameter estimation workflows, and other emerging capabilities.

The workshop is suitable for beginners who want a guided introduction to COPASI as well as experienced users who wish to deepen their understanding of new tools and workflows. We also welcome developers of modeling tools to join the session and explore opportunities for collaboration or how to take advantage of COPASI’s capabilities.
